Building a Docker Image:

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, use the docker build command. Make sure to navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile.
docker build -t your_image_name:tag .

Replace your_image_name with the desired name for your image and tag with a version or label. The dot at the end represents the build context (current directory).
Running a Docker Container:

To run a Docker container based on an image:
docker run -d --name your_container_name -p host_port:container_port your_image_name:tag

    -d: Run the container in the background (detached mode).
    --name: Assign a name to the container.
    -p: Map a port on the host to a port on the container.

Replace your_container_name, host_port, container_port, your_image_name, and tag with your desired values.
